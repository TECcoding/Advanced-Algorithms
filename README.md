## Tc2038.601 Analysis and Design of Advanced Algorithms  
Tecnológico de Monterrey, Estado de México.

This project is based on the original repository maintained by the course instructor **Ariel Ortiz** for the 2025 August–December semester.

The original project contains all the source files that the course instructor writes in class during the semester.  
You can inspect those files directly through GitHub, or you can use git to obtain a local copy:

If necessary, install a git client in your computer.

Clone the instructor's repository. Type at the terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/ariel-ortiz/202513-tc2038.601.git tc2038

Change your current working directory to `tc2038`:

    cd tc2038

You will find all the project source files under this directory.

Every time the instructor updates an existing file or creates a new one, you will need to run the repository pull command. Type at the terminal from within the `tc2038` directory:

    git pull
